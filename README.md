# Week 10

## Mongoose

### Question #1

Describe the differences between a SQL and NoSQL database, and when you might use each.

```text
SQL databases are called as relational databases and NoSQL are non-relational.  SQL databases store their data primarily in tables where NoSQL store their data in documents.  The schema in NoSQL are dynamic and SQL has predetermined schema.
```

### Question #2

What's wrong with this Mongoose code and how might we fix it?

```js
var results = AuthorModel.find({name: "Bob"});
console.log(results);
```

> Hint: Assuming there is a document with a name of "Bob", why does `results` not contain an author model on the second line?

```js
// I'm not completely sure about this, but I think this is the correct answer because just using find will return all documents that have the name: "Bob"
var results = AuthorModel.findOne({name: "Bob"});
console.log(results);
```

### Question #3

Convert the Ruby and ActiveRecord code below into Javascript and Mongoose code:

```rb
@andy = Instructor.find_by(name: "Andy")
@andy.wishlist_items.create(description: "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold")
```

```js
let andy = Instructor.findOne({name: "Andy"})
andy.wishlist_items.push({description: "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold"})
andy.save()
```

### Question #4

Convert the following create method in Mongoose to ActiveRecord.

```js
var author = new Author({name: req.body.name})
author.save(function(err){
  if (!err){
    res.redirect("authors")
  }
})
```

```rb

### Question #6

Write one Express route for each of the four HTTP methods.

Then, make each route respond with a one-word string containing the RESTful action that would most likely be associated with this route.

```js
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

// Your code starts here...

```

### Question #7

Describe the differences between Express and Rails as backend frameworks.

### Question #8

What do the following lines of code do?

```js
var bodyParser = require("body-parser")
app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}))
```

```text
